# UBC MDS Coursework â€“ Spark (PySpark & Scala) & Cassandra

This repository contains selected coursework completed during my **Master of Data Science (MDS) at the University of British Columbia**.  
It demonstrates academic exposure to **distributed data processing** using Spark (PySpark & Scala in Databricks) and **NoSQL database design** using Cassandra.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Spark (PySpark & Scala)
- Used **Scala in Databricks** to generate synthetic customer/order datasets.  
- Built **distributed ETL pipelines** on this data using **PySpark**.  
- Practiced **joins, filtering, and aggregations** in a distributed environment.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **cluster-based data processing** and **Databricks notebooks**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Cassandra (NoSQL)
- Designed and implemented **schemas** for student/course grade datasets.  
- Applied **replication strategies** and explored **partitioning** for scalability.  
- Executed **CRUD queries** with filtering and set operations.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with **PySpark & Scala APIs** for distributed data wrangling.  
- Exposure to **NoSQL (Cassandra)** data modeling concepts.  
- Hands-on understanding of **ETL pipelines, data transformations, and replication strategies**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- This work was completed as part of the **UBC MDS curriculum**.  
- Data is synthetic (customer/order, student/course) and used for **academic demonstration only**.  
- Not production code, but demonstrates proficiency with **Spark, Databricks, Scala, and Cassandra**.
